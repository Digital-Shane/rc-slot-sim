Video poker can offer a higher return-to-player when it is played perfectly, so your RTP can increase. The tradeoff is that Royal Caribbean awards fewer points: 1 RC point per $10 coin-in instead of $5 on slots. If you switch from slots to video poker, update `Coin-in per RC point` in the advanced settings to 10, and `RTP` to reflect your skill level so the simulation reflects the different earning rate.

Video poker played poorly will offer 80% RTP, but skilled players can reach 95-99% RTP in land based casinos, and 95-97% on cruise ships.
