This page details my strategy for optimizing the RC casino rewards point system by engineering the specific signals that casino marketing models actually use. *Details in "Industry Metrics" section.* The goal is to generate the appearance of a consistently high value player while tightly controlling expected loss. By carefully managing daily point targets, rated days, and trip timing, the strategy focuses on maximizing recency, frequency, and average theoretical value in order to sustain premium offers with the minimum necessary play.

This strategy was written **January 2026**, and will go into action April of the same year. I will update this page with resulting reward offers over the course of the next two years. 

#### The First Cruise

* Visit the casino only three days! Limiting point gain to three days in a trip will balance *Average Daily Theo (ADT)* and *Average Trip Theo*
* Gain 2,500 points spread across each day
  * Day 1: 900 points
  * Day 2: 800 points
  * Day 3: 800 points
* Keep a session length of 2–3 hours per day
  * Attempt $2 bets at 5 seconds per spin
  * It should take 3 hours to hit 900 points
* Never spread small bets across many hours
* Adjust bets only to control point pace
* Use any earned free play on the last day after achieving your point target
* Use as lowest volatility machine available.

Low volatility machines are rare, so assuming medium volatility, the initial point gain will cost me about $1,500. Volatility
creates a wide range of possible outcomes, but with a 65% chance of losing only $1,000 and $1,900, this is an acceptable risk
profile for me given the potential rewards.

#### Subsequent Cruises

On any free cruises taken the goal is to maintain high value player status while spending the minimum required to trigger industry models.

* Aim for 100-250 points total
* 1-2 trips per cruise, spreading out play
* Ensure that each cruise has at least one day of meaningful tracked play

#### Cost Documentation

I was able to score a cheaper 6 day cruise because I bet a small amount of money in the casino experimenting with the
machines at the start of this year. The flight ended up adding the most to my trip, but the budget airlines only had overnight
trips that I would not tolerate. This could have been done cheaper. Especially by not buying the drink package. I also need
to pay for dog sitting. It's hard to count all these expenses against this project, because I'll also be enjoying 6 days in
Mexico drinking as much as I want.

I was able to get a cheaper 6 day cruise by betting a small amount in the casino while experimenting with the machines earlier this year.
The flight ended up being the biggest added cost, since the budget airlines only offered overnight trips that I wasn’t willing to take.
This could have been done more cheaply, especially if I had skipped the drink package. I also need to pay for dog sitting. It’s hard to count all of these expenses against the project, since I’ll also be enjoying six days in Mexico with unlimited drinks.
