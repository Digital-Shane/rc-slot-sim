## Words of Caution
None of this information is hidden. Casinos and Royal Caribbean publishes the rules and the point formulas openly. Return-to-player and volatility figures are easily researched. The systems are transparent by design because the operators do not care if a small fraction of players try to optimize against them. They know that the business does not depend on outsmarting the rules; it depends on human behavior. A predictable percentage of players (1–3%) will lose control, exceed any rational stopping threshold, and continue playing long after the math has turned against them. Any attempt to min/max these systems therefore requires a second layer of discipline. Start by honestly assessing whether you have the self control to disengage from an environment that is engineered to prevent you from doing so.
