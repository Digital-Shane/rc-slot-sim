Here are hints you can use to determine the volatility of a machine before you play.

##### Low Volatility

* Max win is relatively small (often ≤ 500×–1,000× bet).
* Simple format: fixed paylines, few stacked mechanics.
* Few/no jackpot tiers.

##### Medium Volatility

* Max win is moderate (~1,000×–5,000× range).
* Some volatility driving mechanics present (moderate multipliers, occasional jackpot tiers).
* “Hold & Spin” style features might exist, but max wins/jackpots aren’t extreme.

##### High Volatility

* Max win is huge (5,000×–10,000×+), often advertised prominently.
* Progressive jackpot and/or multiple jackpot tiers. Progressive jackpots indicate a payout structure that reserves meaningful RTP for rare outcomes.
* Megaways and/or cascading wins plus big multipliers.
* Hold-and-spin style feature with collect symbols + jackpots tied to bet size / “fill the grid” style end condition.
* Info/paytable shows a very wide payout spectrum.
* Multiple bonus features that can stack or multiply.
