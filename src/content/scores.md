Earning enough points to unlock a reward tier is not enough to maintain **premium** offers for the full two years of your status. Casinos expect that some players will hit the reward target and then stop playing. To receive the highest-tier offers for your status for the full duration of your status, expect to put $1,000 - $2,500 of coin-in through slot machines on each free trip. This translates to 200 - 500 casino reward points per trip. You will be offered free play on most trips, which will lower the out-of-pocket cost. If you are not seen as a high-value player, your status will slowly degrade. You will still receive your guaranteed offers, but for less desirable destinations or cruise dates. You will also be less likely to receive additional offers outside of the yearly offer sent at the end of a Club Royale year.

Most casinos use three main metrics when deciding whether to send a marketing offer to loyalty members **recency**, **frequency**, and **monetary**. More metrics are tracked, but these three are the most important for gauging a player's future value and determining who receives free trips. The same total play can produce different marketing outcomes depending on how it’s distributed across days. You must consider multiple scores when planning a min/max strategy. One big binge trip can help monetary a lot, but may not help frequency as much as multiple smaller, separated play days.

#### Recency Score
How recently you played. Measured from your last rated visit or last day with meaningful tracked play. Closer to your last visit is better. In many systems, your recency value effectively decays as weeks pass without play. Many casinos implement this as either:

- Buckets: 0–30 days, 31–90, 91–180, etc. As you move into older buckets, your score drops.
- Decay curve: A gradual decline over time (sometimes sharper after certain thresholds).

A new visit usually “resets” recency back to the best range, but some systems also look at consistent recent activity rather than a single visit.

#### Frequency Score
How often you show up and generate rated play within a given window (last 30/90/180/365 days). More distinct visits are better, but a “visit” usually means a trip or day with meaningful tracked play, not just spending free play or very small amounts. Frequency systems use rolling windows. The casino sets a timeframe, and as earlier trips age out of the window, your frequency score declines. Frequency also factors in active days within a trip. One day of play versus three separate days can matter.

#### Monetary Score
How much theoretical value you generate. Calculated using `coin-in × (1 - return-to-player)`. Tracked as Average Daily Theo (ADT) and Average Trip Theo. Marketing models care about averages, not just totals. If you spread a fixed amount of play across more days, your daily average can drop, even if total coin-in is the same.
